I'll help you create a Python script that interacts with the Spotify API to create a playlist. For this, we'll use the `spotipy` library, which is a Python wrapper for the Spotify Web API.

To use this script, you'll need to:

1. Install the required package:
```bash
pip install spotipy
```

2. Set up a Spotify Developer account:
   - Go to https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard
   - Create a new application
   - Get your Client ID and Client Secret
   - Set up your Redirect URI (can be something like http://localhost:8888/callback)

3. Replace the following placeholders in the code:
   - `YOUR_CLIENT_ID`
   - `YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET`
   - `YOUR_REDIRECT_URI`

4. The script includes two main functions:
   - `search_and_add_tracks()`: Searches for tracks based on search terms
   - `create_spotify_playlist()`: Creates a playlist and adds the tracks

5. You can customize the example usage at the bottom of the script by:
   - Modifying the `songs_to_add` list
   - Changing the playlist name and description
   - Adjusting the playlist privacy settings

The first time you run the script, it will open a web browser for authentication with Spotify.

Would you like me to explain any part of the code in more detail or help you with setting up the Spotify Developer account?
