This script provides a comprehensive solution for uploading a playlist to Apple Music. Here are some key points:

1. Prerequisites:
   - You'll need to install the `applemusicpy` library (`pip install applemusicpy`)
   - Obtain a Developer Token and User Token from Apple Music developer portal
   - These tokens are required for authentication and API access

2. Features:
   - Search for songs on Apple Music
   - Create a new playlist
   - Add songs to the playlist
   - Error handling for song not found or upload failures
   - Detailed logging of the upload process

3. Usage Notes:
   - Replace `DEVELOPER_TOKEN` and `USER_TOKEN` with your actual Apple Music API credentials
   - The `songs_to_upload` list can be customized with your desired songs
   - The script prints out details about successful and failed song additions

4. Potential Improvements:
   - Add more robust error handling
   - Implement rate limiting for API requests
   - Add support for more detailed song matching
